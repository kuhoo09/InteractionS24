  <h1>the time a google doc <br> tarnished one of my childhood memories. </h1>
 
  <h2>move the cursor around to find all 5 parts of the story; read in any order!</h2>

<h3>Last week, <br> when randomly scrolling through my old google docs, I found a <em>newsletter</em> made by 'A' for our Google+ forum. When I tried to find the forum, I found out that Google+ wasn't a thing anymore. </h3>
 
<h6>In 6th grade, my friends and I were obsessed with Harry Potter. <br> So, of course, my friend, who we'll call <em>'A'</em>, and I created a Harry Potter-themed Google+ forum.<br> Our forum had kids from all aorund the world. We had a system for sorting people in Hogwarts houses, for playing Quidditch online, and even held elections for hogwarts profs and prefects.</h6>

<h4>The Harry Potter forum was fun. But soon, <em>A</em> moved to a different country. <br> Even though we tried to stay in touch, we grew apart. <br> And eventually, grew away from Harry Potter and from the forum.</h4>

<h5>After reading the newsletter I felt sad.<br>I felt reminiscent of the times before I was on twitter...<br>before I knew that JKR was a misogynist TERF.<br>I realized that even though I missed those times with my friend, 'A', <br> this memory would be forever tarnished. <br>I could never think of Harry Potter, or even Google+ in the same way again.</h5>

<h7>i did end up reaching out to <em>'A'</em>, who funnily enough, also goes to Parsons now. I complimented his design skills that i saw in the Harry Potter newsletter for our Google+ forum from 9 years ago and continued to think about the google+ era. </h7>
