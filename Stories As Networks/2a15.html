    <p>The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries - embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these very same words, but am an error, a phantom."

            "In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. <br><span class="s1">"I deeply appreciate and am grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."</span>
        </p><p class="p3">
            <span class="s2">"Not in all,"</span> he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing itself toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."Â
