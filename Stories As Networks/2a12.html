    <p>Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said, remarkably tall. We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a large circular clock. I calculated that my pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour. My irrevocable decision could wait.

            "A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native province, learned in astronomy, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave up all the pleasures, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up in the Pavilion for thirteen years, with nothing but manuscripts remaining after his death. The family, as you know, wished to consign them to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a monk - insisted on their publication." 
        </p><p class="p3">
            "Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk. Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter, while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... his Labyrinth..."
         </p> <p class="p4">
            "Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet.
