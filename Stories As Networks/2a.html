        <p>I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German. <span class="s1"> It was that of Captain Richard Madden.</span> Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. 1 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk. Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable.
