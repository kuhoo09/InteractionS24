        <p>Albertâ€™s face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor.  
        </p><p class="p2">
            I lifted my eyes and in the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.         
        </p> <p class="p3">
           <span class="s1"> Nothing mattered anymore,</span> and I knew what needed to be done. I reached into my pocket, and had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.
