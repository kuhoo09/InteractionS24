The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death.

There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me... The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering thoughts.
