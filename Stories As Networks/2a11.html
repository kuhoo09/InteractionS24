    <p>Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.     
         </p><p class="p2">
            "The garden?"
        </p><p class="p3">
            "The garden of forking paths."
         </p> <p class="p4">
            Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:
         </p> <p class="p5">
            "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen." 
         </p><p class="p6">
            "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."
            </p> <p class="p7">
                The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house, we went into a library filled with books. I recognized some large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. They had never been printed.
